#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is the study of systematic creation,design,developing, and  maintaining of software products for computer systems and other electrical devices.
It is in important in that it is;
 Efficient-creation of well-engineered systems when used they tend to be fast to perform task ths saves time thus assures optimization of high perfomance and efficiency.
 Innovation - it allows development of new apps ,products and services that make life better by offering different solutions.
 scalability and flexibility-a proper scalable developed system  can  adapt to new changes of requirements and technlogies thus can grow with increasing demands.
 reliabilty- with proper software engineering practices, a more  reliable and stability ensures reducton in errors or system failures in crutial systems.
 Security -in software engineering  principles, it considers security as  key thus it protects the system privacy and data from cyber threats.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. 
 Establishment  of software engeneering in 1960s-the term software engeneering was introduced and it was made a discipline hence lai a foundation fo software engineering as a formal proffession.
 Introduction of structured programming in 1970s-it revolutionised code readability and userbility thus influenced development of prrogramming languages such as c,creating a path for sotware development.
 Agile manifestationin 2000s-


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 Planning and requirements-identifing , gathering and documenting specifc user needs and system requirments. 
 Design-creating well detailed software framework(user interface,system design and database design)
  according to user specification.
 Implementation -writing the code and building  software(according to the design phase) according to the design specfications.
 Testing -conducting various tests to identifing bugs and fix them,thus to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
 Deployment -releasing the software to the envronment it is intended and users to access.
 Maintainance -provide ongoing support,updates,and enhancements to the software after deployment.
 
 
 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   waterfall is a linear and sequential approach with  a clear scope  and predictable timeline.
    Characteristics ; it involves process which is divided into sequentional phases and its difficult to make changes  once a phase is completed.Testing is done after development phase.
FOr waterfall it is applied majourly in construction projects e.g a company to construct a new office they use the waterfall approach since it is linear process.This structured approach ensures the people involved such as stakeholderss understand the timeline and deliverables of the given project  thus to save time  so to avoid delays.Other places of application are  in manufacturing process ,regulatory compliance and e.t.c
   
   Agile it is flexible and iterative approach that enables teams to quickly adapt to changes of requirements and achieve  high quality results within short timelines.
   characteristics;
   -it adapts to changes hence flexible
   -Allows continuous collaboration due to regular feedbacks and reviews
   -testing is done throughought developmentand work is delivered in  parts,
   -it is dynamic hence applied in marketing ,product managment majourly in ecommerce also in software development such as the gaming industry where the agile method is used to ctreate  games in stages and deliver to players to test  and get feedback so they can make adjustment to user satisfaction experience before launching it officially.
   
      
  
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a)software developer-responsible for writing code and maintaining software applications as the role
-code-write a clean,efficient and maintainable code as of  needed specification,
-Design and debug-design the software archituctue and decisions and in turn identify and fixs errors within the code,
-documentation-gies a documentation on what is done 
b)Quality Assuarance engineer-role is to ensure the quality and functionality of the software products through testing.
-Test and verification-develop and executes test plans to identify defects and in turn very if the software meets the specifications as required to perform
-Report-gives acommunication and  documentation of the test  results and issues to the development team
-Collaboration-involves other members of the team in what to improve or change
c)Project manager-incharge of overseeing the planning,execution and delivery of the software projects and ensure they meet the deadline and bugdet constraints
-Planning and coordination-define project scope ,objectives e.t.c create the project planwith tmelins and budget allocaion and in turn  ensure effective communication & collaboration between stakeholders and team members.
-Monitoring and budget managment-truck the project process,address any issue that arises while developing ,contact stakeholders by providing the progress on the project  and addressing concerns.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
integrated development environment-software suites that provide comprehesive tools for writting,debugging and testing a code e.g visual studio,
it converts human readable code  into simplified language that  a computer or machine can understand.

Version controlled systems(VCS)-this are tools in software used for tracking changes to a given source code and is used to coorndinate work among team members e.g git,it keeps records of changes  that takes place as a modification.
It allows many developers to work on the same code database .

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-tight deadlines where there is pressur to finish the project at a certain time-they shoould be  encouragement of flexible working schedule and supportive managment practices to ensure the engineers delivers what is needed and of high quality .
-changing requirementss which can cause delay of project timeline-encourange continue learning through training and  clearly define the project scope and use agile methologies for managing changes
-technical debt where shortcuts taken while developing leads to  conduct code reviews to maintain the quality of the code regularly.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit testing-This s testing of individual modules of a software thus ensures each part functions correctly as it stands alone
-Integration testing-involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems therefore,it  ensures data flows is smoothly between the interfaces and modules as needed to.
-System testing-involves tesing the entire software as a whole hence it ensures functionality is met based on its userbility and how it performs in general.
-Acceptance testing-testing of software against user requirements to ensure it meets users needs ,in that it requires the whole application runs and the business requirement are met and ready to work.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-prompt engineering is the crafting of qustions or statements to get the best possible responses from ai models.

Importance-it improves users experience when you give clear and specific detailed  prompts ,one gets the particular correct answer to what prompt entailed thus satisfies the users needs
it reduces misinterpretation-when propmpts are crafted well one gets precise answers as correctly required thus it increases accuracy by the model hence one can rely on it.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-"what  is the best method for a student to learn"
--- improved "what is the best method  for a final year university student studying online to learn "
By being clear and specifc it gives a clear guidance of what exactly is needed rather than being ambiguous and generalizing it gives just the key points regarding the specification of learning online .
